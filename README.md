## Nagata Shachu in AR
An AR experience by [CAM Collective](https://collective-cam.carrd.co/#) for the [Nagata Shachu](https://nagatashachu.com/) Taiko Ensemble using AR.js and AFrame.

## Build Status

Jul - 30 - 2020
- Got the video working and able to count the number of videos playing then mute the rest of the videos to handle playing multiple markers at a time 

Jul - 21 - 2020
- Got the video working and testing with multiple markers - using presets "hiro" and "kanji"

## Testing
1. Download and open index.html either on a local server or hosted server. Visit the page on a device and point camera to the AR markers
2. To test you can find the markers on this page https://webspace.ocad.ca/~3164460/nagataShachu/test.html
